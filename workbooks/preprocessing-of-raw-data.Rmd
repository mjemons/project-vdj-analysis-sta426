# Preprocessing of the raw Data

## Demultiplexing

The files presented were derived from 10x-genomics. Since the pipeline BraCeR
requires single cells in separate files the 10x-genomics data had to be
demultiplexed, i.e. separate each cell data in a separate directory containing
the mapped sequences related to that cell. This was done using the following
python script.


```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library (reticulate)
use_python("usr/local/bin/python")
```


```{python, eval = FALSE}
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

"""demultiplexer.py

This script demultiplex the data, i.e. it creates a separate file for each
cell containing the contigs.

This script produces a folder structure with the following structure:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
