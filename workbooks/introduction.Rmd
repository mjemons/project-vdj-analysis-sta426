# Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an automimmune disease affecting the central nervous system. It attacks the myelein-sheet of neurons affects alone in the US $\sim$ 1 Mio. patients. [@ramesh] Patients often experience impairments of visual, sensory, motor, neurocognitive and autonomic functions. One form of MS is the relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) which is characterised by active phases of the disease (relapse; REL) and inactive phases (remission; REM). [@jelcic]

There is a broad consensus that MS is in fact due to a dysregulated adaptive immunity. In the immune response of MS several cells are known to be important LIKE CD4+ T-Cells, CD8+ T-cells as well as B-cells and autoantibodies. A phenomenon called autoproliferation (AP) (self-reactivity) of T cells and B cells seems to play an important role in MS. Autoproliferation is mediated by memory B-cells, as the depletion of B-cells leads to reduced T cell autoproliferation. This is as well one of the principles behind B cell-depleting therapies, underlining the importance of pro-inflammatory B-cells. Previous studies have found that the frequency of AP cells was different between stages of RRMS, being higher in REL than in REM. [@jelcic] In this project we focused on the analysis of B cells. 

B cells are lymphocytes and part of the adaptive immune response. At its surface is the B-cell receptor (BCR) that can bind to antigens. Upon binding the B-cell will differentiate into plasma cells (a type of effector cell) that later on produce immunoglobulins (Ig) and those will target the object whose antigen bound to the BCR. [@janeway]

The general process of adaptive immunity was developed as the clonal selection theory. This theory states that in the body are many different B cells each capable of producing specific antibodies and correspondinc specific BCRs. In this pool of many different B cells, those that bind an antigen upon infection are activated to divide will produces many identical copies of themselves, so called clones. This process is called clonal expansion producing clonotypes. [@janeway]

In order to make inferences about the clonality and clonal expansion it is important to reconstruct the sequence of the BCR from single cell RNA sequencing data (scRNA seq). This will allow for usage of the entire transcriptomic identity of the B-cell without the need to use special targeted sequencing protocols like repertoire sequencing (Rep Seq). The tool employed in this project that can achieve BCR reconstruction from scRNA seq data is BraCeR, an extension to the previously developed TraCeR for TCR reconstruction. [@lindeman] [@stubbington]

In the context of this project the were provided with B-cell sequencing data from 31 patients which were categorised as being either autoproliferating (AP) or non-autoproliferating (nonAP). The disease status (RRMS NAT - treated with monoclonal antibodies, RRMS nihil - untreated and Healthy Donors) was recorded for each. More information on the dataset will be available in the next chapter.
