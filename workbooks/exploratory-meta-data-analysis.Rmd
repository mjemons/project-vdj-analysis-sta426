# Exploratory Meta-Data Analysis

The patient meta-data was provided in an Rds file and was prepared with the following commands:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(stringr)

#loading the data and selecting the relevant columns
experiment = readRDS("/Users/martinemons/polybox/Universitaet/MSc_CBB/HS2020/Statistical Analysis of HSD/vdj-analysis-local/sce_B.rds", refhook = NULL)
cellUMI2SampleType = colData(experiment) %>% as.data.frame %>% select(lib_id, patient_id, Sample.Type, Diagnosis) %>% unique()

#counting the number of AP and nonAP patients
count_ap <- sum(str_count(cellUMI2SampleType$Sample.Type, "CFSEhi CD19+"))
count_nonap <- sum(str_count(cellUMI2SampleType$Sample.Type, "CFSEdim CD19+"))
```

The number of AP patients in the dataset is `r count_ap` and the number of nonAP patients is `r count_nonap`.
