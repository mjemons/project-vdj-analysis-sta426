# project-vdj-analysis
This repository contains the final project of STA426, completed by Richard Affolter, Martin
Emons and Philip Hartout. The goal of this project is to investigate clonal
expansion among B cells donated by patients affected by RRMS (treated with
Natalizumab and untreated), as well as healthy donors. Prior to being subject to
single-cell RNA sequencing, the B cells were incubated with CFSE to assess _in
vitro_ autoproliferation.

## Outline
This project is set up as follows:

1. Introduction
2. EDA
3. Bracer workflow setup details
4. Clonal expansion analysis
5. Conclusion

A full overview, analysis and summary of this project can be found in the [workbooks  directory](/workbooks/).
